        <pageTitle><![CDATA[Lottery Winner To Name Her Baby After The Lottery]]></pageTitle>
        <shortDescription><![CDATA[Choosing a name for your baby can be a daunting prospect, as it stays with them for the rest of their life, so it's usually a big decision. Not for a recent lottery winner though, who after winning the lottery, has decided to name her unborn child Max, after the lottery.]]></shortDescription>
        <contentText><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p>A Canadian lottery player, Erin Moore won $126,968.50 on the Lotto Max draw on January 13th.  She’s so happy about winning the lottery, that she told lottery officials that she will be naming her unborn child Max, after Lotto Max.</p>

<p>“I will be naming my little boy Max,” said the Lotto Max winner, from Owen Sound in Ontario. <br /><br />She said that not only is she extremely lucky to have fallen pregnant, but now she has also got lucky on the lotto. <br /><br />“I had surgery years ago that meant I wouldn’t have any more children so this baby is a gift,” said Erin after she matched six out of seven drawn numbers, plus the bonus number on her ticket.<br /><br />Erin said that the lottery win couldn’t have come at a better time. “I have two wonderful daughters and this little boy is due very soon,” she continued.<br /><br />With the lottery winnings finally reflecting in her bank account, Erin said that she plans to start her own business, take care of her two daughters, and of course go on a shopping spree for cute baby goodies.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Winning the lottery gives me freedom – it’s awesome,”</strong></em> said Erin.</p>
<p>Erin purchased her winning lottery ticket at Winber Mart on 2nd Avenue East in Owen Sound. </p>

<p><strong>Mad about Max</strong><br /><br />The name Max is pretty up there when it comes to strong male names. Max in its traditional Latin form is Maximus, meaning ‘greatest.’ This must be way so many celebrity parents have chosen variations of the name in droves. <br /><br />Among them are, Charlie Sheen, Christina Aguilera, Dustin Hoffman, Steven Spielberg, Gilbert Gottfried, Lance Armstrong, Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony and quite a few more have all been mad about various forms of Max over the years. <br /><strong><br />SuperEna Max Lottery</strong><br /><br />Speaking of lotteries with the name Max in it – there’s one lotto game by the name of <strong>SuperEna Max</strong> that has taken the world by storm, and is currently sitting at a whopping <strong>€97,750,000</strong> for this Saturday!</p>]]></contentText>

        <pageTitle><![CDATA[Online lotteries – How Much Do You Know?]]></pageTitle>
        <shortDescription><![CDATA[As seasoned online lottery players on, you might think that you know just about everything there is to know about playing the biggest international lotteries from the comfort of your home, office, tablet or smartphone. But, you’d be pretty surprised…]]></shortDescription>
        <contentText><![CDATA[<p>Not too long ago we came across quite a few lotto facts that put even us to the test. Let’s take a look at some fun lottery findings, and see how many you know. <br /><br /><strong>The lottery wish list</strong><br /><br />Last week you probably took part in our Easter competition where we asked you to choose which lotto dream would hatch out of the Golden Easter Egg. Among the choices were Diving for diamonds in the Caribbean, purchasing a Lamborghini Adventador, Hot air balloon tour in Gstaad, Switzerland, owning your very own lake on your estate etc.  But, according to statistics, lottery winners love to help out their friends and family before spending money on themselves. Once the family and friends are out of the way, a massive 70% of winners choose to purchase new homes. <br /><br />Surprisingly though, 10% of lottery winners don’t just buy one new vehicle – the majority actually end up buying more than 10! Right here, we can already see what it means to join the lives of the rich, where monies no problem and your heart gets what it really wants. <br /><br />Going through the stats we also see that there are the usual purchases like exotic vacations, luxury travel and designer shopping sprees. <br /> <br />Now we come to the wildly unusual purchases like a new pair of hips, tarantulas, and even a fireworks company. It just shows you, we are all unique in our own way, and hey, if it’s what you’ve always wanted – go for it!</p>
<p><img src="https://backoffice.playhugelottos.com/uploads/assets//01_News/PlayHuge/buy_lottery_tickets_online.jpg" alt="Lottery wish list" title="lottery wish list" width="519" height="412" /></p>
<p><strong>To work, or not to work – that is the question</strong><br /><br />How often have we told our fellow colleagues, friends and family members that the very second we win the lottery, we will quit our jobs?  Seems quite a lot I know, but the truth of the matter is, 60% of lottery winners carry on working after hitting the jackpot!  15% move on to new jobs, and 45% start their own companies. The remaining 40% go on early retirement. With a bit of luck, and to keep most of our lottery dreams alive, we can only hope that this batch are lapping up the luxury, sipping on cocktails on some exotic beach with the sand between their well-manicured toes.</p>
<p><strong>Spreading the lotto love<br /></strong><br />Giving family members a cut from your huge lottery win can be quite a job and it can also very easily give you the biggest headache. So, just in case you are lucky enough to win <strong>tonight’s massive $85 million <a href="https://www.playhugelottos.com/en/play-the-lottery/usa-powerball.html" target="_blank" title="Play Powerball online">US Powerball</a> jackpot</strong> you might want to know what others before you have dealt with this sticky issue. A massive 83% of new lotto millionaires share their win with their loved ones. 66% have gone to their siblings, 57% have given a share to their own children, and 51% of new lottery winners have given back to their parents.</p>
<p><strong>Hitting the BIG one!</strong><br /><br />Hitting a big lotto jackpot without a doubt opens doors you never thought possible. 38% of jackpot winners pack up and completely relocate once their fortunes change. 75% of these lucky lottery players purchase brand new homes, and 24% move to a new country altogether.  For those who prefer to stay in their own country, 19% of lottery winners jet off overseas for the very first time on vacation. 7% buy an RV to look after them on their travels, like the latest Australian jackpot winners, who wish to remain anonymous. <br /><br />With<strong> this week’s <a href="https://www.playhugelottos.com/en/play-the-lottery/superenamax.html" target="_blank" title="Play SuperEnaMax online">SuperEna Max</a> jackpot sitting at €93.5 million</strong>, we suggest you not only play the lottery online but make sure your passports up to date - looks like you could be opening up some brand new doors of your own any minute!</p>
<p><strong>Lottery winners never stop playing the lotto</strong><br /><br />One the most surprising stats might be that a full two thirds of jackpot lottery winners keep playing the lotto. If you think they’re crazy and that lighting never strikes twice – thing again. <br /> <br />One lucky lotto player, who has more luck than he knows what to do with, won the lottery a jaw-dropping 14 times! Fourteen! <br /><br />Another lottery winner defied all odds, by winning the lottery twice. You might be thinking but you just said someone won the lottery fourteen times, so why now mention someone winning the lottery twice. Well, this lucky lotto player did it with the same set of lottery numbers!  That’s definitely one for the books, and if you ever thought that the odds will never be in your favour – try speaking to these lucky lotto players. They will be telling you a very different story.</p>
<p><img src="https://backoffice.playhugelottos.com/uploads/assets//01_News/PlayHuge/hand_on_head.jpg" alt="surprised man" title="lottery winner wins the lottery fourteen times" width="624" height="415" /></p>

        <pageTitle><![CDATA[A Millionaire Lotto Lifestyle In A Nutshell]]></pageTitle>
        <shortDescription><![CDATA[If you really want to win the lottery, then you have more than likely repeatedly asked yourself the following question: "What is it like to be a millionaire?" Very few of us really imagine what the ordinary days of millionaires are like, so let's take a look just how your daily routine will change if you are lucky enough to win this week’s seriously huge €235 million SuperEna Max jackpot right here at]]></shortDescription>
        <contentText><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.playhugelottos.com/en/play-the-lottery/superenamax.html" title="Play SuperEnaMax online"><img src="https://backoffice.playhugelottos.com/uploads/assets//01_News/PlayHuge/235M_SEM.png" alt="Super Jackpot Week" title="Super Jackpot Week" width="660" height="241" /></a></p>
<p>We’ve all at one point or another stumbled upon images or articles about the rich and famous, and its completely natural that we too fantasize about being able to be in a position to enjoy all the finer things that this world has to offer; be in travelling in your very own private jet, owning an entire island, rubbing shoulders with celebrities at the Cannes Film Festival, before you jet off to your villa in Aspen. <br /><br />But what is the life of a millionaire really?<br /><br />Although most lottery players hope that one day they too will become insanely rich, it’s extremely important to make sure that you are prepared to deal with everything that comes along with having more than enough money at your disposal. <br /><br />You will need to make informed decisions (sometimes even risky ones) in order to truly become a member of this prestigious club. What might actually surprise you though, is that most millionaires who manage to keep their wealth, instead of losing it all, live rather ordinary lives.<br /><br />Millionaires have more in common with each other than just their bank accounts however, and for some, striking it rich took vision, courage, salesmanship, and of course passion.<br /><br />Let’s take a look at traits are most common to the seven-figure bank account set, and what you can do to hone some of these skills when playing the lottery online:</p>
<p><img src="https://backoffice.playhugelottos.com/uploads/assets//01_News/PlayHuge/escape_the_grind.PNG" alt="Escape the grind" title="Escape the grind and play the lotto online" width="600" height="137" /></p>
<p><strong>Vision</strong><br /><br />One of the most important trait of a millionaire, is that they have vision.  They also have a natural positive attitude. Not just because they already have money and so we think, “well of course they are positive. I too would be positive with all the dosh lying around.”  This isn’t the case though. They have always been positive. It’s their big dreams and the fact they also believe they will come true, that gave them the ability to go out and be successful in the first place. As such, online lottery players, such as yourself, should set lofty goals and not be afraid to play international lottery games online. <br /><br /><strong>Passion</strong><br /><br />In the words of Warren Buffet, "Money is a by-product of something I like to do very much." If you you’re reading this, then you love playing the lottery, so it’s definitely a win-win situation.  So too should you enjoy what you do for a living. If you enjoy doing what you do – it’s not a job anymore, it’s a passion. Everyone will see this passion and want to invest too. <br /><br />Finding your dream career though may take time, as the average millionaire doesn't find it until age 45, and tends to be 54 (on average) before becoming a millionaire. In fact, millionaires tend to have tried at least an average of seventeen ventures before they were successful. <br /><br />So, if you want to be rich, stop doing things you don't enjoy and do what you love. <br /><strong><br />Millionaires do not give out money for nothing</strong><br /><br />One thing to remember though is that just about every millionaire constantly has issues with people asking for money, and sometimes it’s not easy to determine which of them really is worth attention. This problem is especially significant if you managed to win the lottery and became a millionaire overnight. Friends, relatives and even religious communities, to which you may belong to, consider you obligated to share their financial success. Herein lies the complication of charity.  <br /><br />Millionaires are generous donors, but the way they prefer to give away their money may surprise you:<br /><br />1. These people have always been generous donors. Even before they became millionaires. Generosity is a character trait, and not the result of a huge balance in a bank account.<br /><br />2. They will not give you money simply because you are asking for it. They will delve into your circumstances and make sure that you will use the money wisely.  It’s always important to remember that charity is a two-way process, and it makes no difference how poor or rich one of the parties are. What is important is what the donation will be used for. <br /><br />3. If you manage to win the lottery, do not rush to give money to your children if you do not want to regret it for the rest of your life. Rather make sure that their financial security for the future is taken care of and then let them learn the value of money as they grow up. Letting them learn how to succeed independently is one of the greatest gifts you can give them. <br /><br />The most important thing to remember about money is that regardless of your education level, IQ score, or performance in school, you have everything it takes to become a millionaire and earn all your desire. Stop thinking about money in terms of fear and scarcity, and start thinking about it through the eyes of freedom, possibility, opportunity and abundance.<br /><br />The truth is you don’t have to launch a blockbuster tech company or sport the last name Buffett to be a millionaire – all you have to do is make sure you have at least one ticket into this week’s life-changing SuperEna Max draw!</p>

        <shortDescription><![CDATA[If there was ever two things that go perfectly hand in hand then it’s the lottery and the F1 Grand Prix – as both offer thrills, adrenalin and a minted millionaire lifestyle. Which is why it’s no surprise at all that there's a new Powerball ad out giving F1 fans a taste of what it's like to live in the lap of luxury - in an adrenaline-fuelled outdoor stunt that is. Intrigued?  Then carry one reading…]]></shortDescription>
        <contentText><![CDATA[<p><strong>Remember:</strong> each ticket you buy gets you entries into our <strong>Monaco Grand Prix competition</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://backoffice.playhugelottos.com/uploads/assets//01_News/PlayHuge/April_fools_day_SEM.PNG" alt="Win the lottery this April Fool's Day" title="Win the lottery this April Fool's Day" width="646" height="226" /></p>
<p>One the 1st of April, every year, pranksters all across the country come out to play practical jokes on their friends and workmates. <br /><br />When it comes to the lottery, one of the biggest practical jokes could be that someone pranks you into believing that you have won the jackpot. However, there were quite a few lottery players that had the last laugh when they realised that their lucky lottery numbers did in fact find luck when they bagged the top prize on the lottery on April Fool’s Day.<br /> <br /><strong>Richard and Angela Maxwell</strong><br /><br />The biggest lottery jackpot winners who won a unbelievable £53 million on the EuroMillions lottery is retired couple Richard and Angela Maxwell.  They too thought that someone must be playing an elaborate joke on them as it was after April Fool’s day.<br /> <br />“I always keep our lottery ticket in the kitchen drawer so I took a break and went online to check the results,” he said. “I checked again and again, five times in total, as I couldn’t believe it. Then I saw only one ticket had won £53m and I was in shock. I thought someone had scanned my ticket somehow and put it on the website as a joke. It was April Fool’s Day after all.”<br /><br />It was only after Richard eventually verified the lottery numbers online that he really believed they had won the big one.</p>
<p>At the time Richard’s wife, Angela was out cooking for a local pensioners’ lunch club.  Richard knew that she would never answer her phone as she would be too busy and besides, he would much rather tell her the amazing news in person. <br /><br />But waiting until Angela finally go home was quite a task.</p>
<p>“I kept myself busy making cups of tea for the builders because I couldn’t sit still but didn’t say anything to anyone.”</p>
<p>Angela did eventually come strolling into the house and asked Richard about their dinner plans for the evening. <br /><br />Richard said, “We can’t go out for dinner, Angela, I’ve got something to tell you.”<br /><br />To that Angela said, “I didn’t know what to think. Richard just went red in the face and then said ‘we’ve won £53m’. I just said ‘don’t be stupid’ – he’s always playing jokes so I thought it was an April Fool’s Day. I just didn’t believe it, then he showed me the numbers on the website and I dropped the basket of tea towels on the floor. Then I just sat down in the chair for about half an hour, stunned.”<br /><br />“£1m would have been amazing but £53m enables you to do so much, not just for you but those around you,” he said. “Our local community is really important to us, in particular helping young people in the area. The win will enable us to spend more time getting involved as well as give financial support.”<br /><br />The hefty jackpot winners used some of their new found wealth on a luxury holiday to New Zealand. They also bought themselves a Range Rover and a couple of designer handbags just for starters.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Kelso</strong></p>
<p>If your husband walked into the house on April Fool’s Day saying, “We won the lottery!” Would you believe him?  <br /><br />Well this is exactly what Jonathan Kelso did – and his wife just rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>Jonathan Kelso won the top prize in a GOLD RUSH Scratch-Off game from the Florida Lottery.  Not only did he get super lucky winning the lottery on the 1st April, he also purchased the lotto ticket with a $5 bill he happened to find on the ground! <br /><br />Speaking at a press conference, Jonathan said, “The hardest part was convincing my wife that we had won because it happened on April Fool’s Day!”</p>
<p><strong>Jim and Maureen Emerton<br /></strong><br />Jim and Maureen Emerton from Nottinghamshire scooped a whopping £4.450.000 on the UK Lottery. Just like the other two lottery winners, Ms. Emerton’s husband also thought she was fooling around when she told him that they had won the lottery. <br /><br />“I’m a fool, I like playing tricks on people and I thought, ‘Someone’s got me back.’ I said to her ‘How have you done this?’ I thought it was a trick ticket. The more she said it, the more I didn’t believe her because she didn’t seem that excited. She said it was because she just couldn’t believe it,” recalled Jim Emerton.</p>
<p><strong>David Kalanik</strong><br /><br />A 54-year-old Milford man struck gold and became $5.000.000 richer all because he played the Mega Millions lottery. Although he didn’t win the lottery on April Fool’s day, it could quite easily be a April Fools’ joke.<br /><br />“I checked my ticket the morning after the drawing and just sat there in disbelief. I called my wife in to confirm I had won because I just couldn’t believe my eyes. We were both elated. The winning numbers were on the top line of the ticket and I didn’t even bother to check the rest of the numbers,” said Kalanik after collecting the windfall.</p>
<p><strong>Sherill and Ernie Johnson</strong><br /><br />Another lottery winner whose wife thought he was tricking her into believing he won the lottery is Ernie Johnson. Ernie’s wife, Sherill sent him out to buy dinner. He came home and said he had just won $1.000.000 on the lottery. Naturally still buzzing due to the lotto win, Ernie completely forgot to buy dinner. Sherill on the other hand simply thought her husband was pranking her as they had just gone through a host of April Fool’s Day pranks a couple of days prior. Even when he showed the lotto ticket to his wife, she still had a hard time believing that it was real.<br /><br />“It was so close to April Fools’ Day that I didn’t believe him at first,” said Sherill.</p>
<p><strong>30 school staff members from Widnes</strong><br /><br />As we have seen, it’s a pretty hard job convincing someone that you have won the lottery on April Fool’s Day. Now imagine trying to convince 30 people. This is what Julie Connaughton had to face when her syndicate from the Simms Cross Primary School in Widnes scooped £1.000.000.  <br /><br />“I think it took most of the day to convince everyone that we really had won! Everyone has mixed emotions, going from literally dancing around school, to full on tears of joy and excitement,” said Julie.</p>
<p>With so many lucky lotto players winning the lottery on April Fool’s Day - you'd be a fool to miss out playing any of our amazing lotteries today!</p>

        <shortDescription><![CDATA[2017 is kicking off to a GRAND start on here with the most eagerly anticipated contest of the year – our annual Monaco F1 Grand Prix competition.]]></shortDescription>
        <contentText><![CDATA[<p>Time and time again we come across yet another lottery winner that out of sheer negligence or absent-mindedness failed to collect the money? In fact right now, there an Irish lotto player who was lucky enough to win €1 million on the National Lottery’s Christmas Millionaire Raffle might not claim his life-changing lotto win. The lucky winner has just two more days to claim the prize before it becomes totally worthless.</p>
<p><img src="https://backoffice.playhugelottos.com/uploads/assets//01_News/PlayHuge/sand_timer_news.PNG" alt="Sand timer" title="Sand timer" width="296" height="405" /></p>
<p>Lottery officials are urgently appealing to locals in the Cork area to double check their lottery tickets to see if they have the winning lottery numbers. The only information lottery officials have, is that the ticket was purchased at a Topaz garage, on Lower Tivoli Road on December 21st.  <br /><br />The rules states that the owner of the winning ticket has to claim their prize within 90 days of the draw – that’s this Friday! If no one comes forward to claim the prize, the prize will go back into the Irish National Lottery prize fund. <br /><br />Michael Hayes, Head of the Irish National Lottery marketing department said, “Christmas Millionaire Raffle tickets are a popular gift at Christmas time so we would appeal to all those who have bought a ticket as a gift or who may have received a ticket from a loved one to check their tickets for a chance of claiming a life-changing €1 million prize.”<br /><br />Niall Buckley, the manager of the store that sold the winning ticket, said “It would be fantastic to see whoever it is claim the prize in time.”<br /><br />Every year there are lottery prizes worth hundreds of millions of dollars that go unclaimed, so why do some lottery winners fail to collect their amazing lotto wins after winning a lottery? Let’s find out! <br /><br /><strong>Some lottery players completely forget that they even played</strong></p>
<p>When purchasing a lottery ticket form a store, it can be easy to forget that you bought a lotto ticket.  After all you probably went into the store for something completely different and while waiting in line spotted the next available jackpot and thought “Hey, why not. I’m feeling pretty lucky.” Or of course you looked into your wallet and thought you need to bump up your funds. What better way than winning lottery right? So you buy the life-changing lottery ticket and tuck in safely in your wallet, handbag or pocket.  Your ticket to financial freedom could quite easily now be a distant dream, just like that.</p>
<p>Of the $40 billion worth prize money won from various international lotto games such as the mighty Mega Millions or the record-breaking US Powerball in the US, $800 million has gone completely unclaimed.</p>
<p>One of the reasons so many lottery wins go unclaimed is that lottery players just forget to check the results. <br /><br />Luckily, you don’t have this problem on PlayHugeLottos.com, as you will receive an automated email with not only the winning lottery numbers but it will also reflect if you had any matches – so feel free to throw away that highlighter – we have taken care of business.</p>
<p>Now you may be thinking, what if the email lands up in your spam filters or you just don’t open the email.  Once again we have you covered! Not only will you get the email but if you have won substantial amount – we will call you. That’s right. One of our amazing Customer Care representatives will personally call you and make sure you know that you have won a seriously huge lotto prize. After all we’re in the business of making millionaires, and that’s exactly what we intend to do!<br /><br /><strong>Just because you didn’t win the jackpot does not mean you didn’t become a millionaire </strong><br /><br />Every single lotto game has secondary prizes, not just jackpots. Sure, winning the $1.6 billion on the Powerball would be mind-boggling good. But even if you didn’t match every number drawn, you could still win a massive lotto prize.  <br /><br />On Powerball the secondary prizes are fixed at $1 million – which instantly makes you a millionaire, even though you didn’t win the jackpot. <br /><br />On the EuroMillions, the secondary prizes are worth a fortune too, so when you fail to show interest in double checking your lottery tickets just because you heard someone else won the jackpot, don’t - you could still have won an absolutely whopper of prize too. <br /><br /><strong>Lost the ticket!</strong><br /><br />The ultimate nightmare! Can you for one second imagine seeing all your lottery numbers come up one by one and you win the jackpot?  What a feeling – and then after you double check the lottery results you see it confirmed that you are the only winner!  Come Monday morning you get dressed in your best and head off to claim your prize – but there’s a real problem – you can’t find the lottery ticket!  <br /><br />There are many people who win a lottery and suddenly find out that they have lost the ticket, and that it’s nowhere to be found. A French couple won the EuroMillions jackpot in 2013, but couldn’t collect their prize because they lost the lottery as they had left it in the laundry! <br /><br />Another couple, Martyn and Kay Tott, from the UK won a £3 million jackpot, but lost the ticket and could not produce a proof of purchase, and so while they had the sympathy of the organizers, and even though it was clear that they were telling the truth about being the lottery winners, the prize money was denied to them. <br /><br />Once again, you will never experience this if you play the lottery at PlayHugeLottos.com. Oh, the joys of playing the lotto online…<br /><br />Finally, you won’t win a lottery unless you participate in one. If you don’t play, you will never win – it’s as simple as that. <br /><br />Each one of us has a chance of winning this Friday’s $174 million MegaMillions jackpot, this Thursday’s €155 million SuperEna Max or this Friday’s €60 million Eurojackpot – provided you login and take a shot at it.<br /><br />The lottery is there to be won, and anyone who plays has a chance to win it. Will you be the next lucky winner?</p>
